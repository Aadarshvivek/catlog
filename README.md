# Catalog Placements Assignment - Online

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for a simplified implementation of **Shamir's Secret Sharing** algorithm as part of a coding assignment. The goal is to find the constant term, `c`, of an unknown polynomial given in specific test cases.

## Problem Statement

The task involves solving for the constant term, `c`, of a polynomial represented by the following structure:

\[ f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + ... + a_1 x + c \]

Where:
- `m` is the degree of the polynomial.
- `c` is the constant term to be found.

The polynomial's points are provided in JSON format, with x-values and encoded y-values that are in various numeric bases. This requires decoding the y-values into decimal format, using a minimum of `k` points to determine the polynomial coefficients. 

### Input Format

The input is provided in a JSON file. Each test case contains:
- `n`: The number of points (x, y) provided.
- `k`: The minimum number of points needed to find the polynomial coefficients (using interpolation).

Each point is structured as follows:
```json
"x_value": {
    "base": "numeric_base",
    "value": "encoded_y_value"
}
```

### Output

For each test case, the program should output the constant term, `c`, of the polynomial.

## Solution Approach

1. **Parse JSON Input**: Read the test cases from a JSON file.
2. **Decode y-values**: Convert the y-values from their given base to decimal.
3. **Apply Polynomial Interpolation**: Use Lagrange interpolation or a similar method to calculate the polynomial coefficients.
4. **Extract the Constant Term (c)**: Once the polynomial is formed, retrieve the constant term.

### Assumptions and Constraints

- The coefficients are positive integers within the range of a 256-bit number.
- The provided points (n) will always be greater than or equal to the required minimum points (k).
- The degree of the polynomial (m) is determined by `m = k - 1`.

## Sample Input

```json
{
    "keys": {
        "n": 4,
        "k": 3
    },
    "1": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "4"
    },
    "2": {
        "base": "2",
        "value": "111"
    },
    "3": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "12"
    },
    "6": {
        "base": "4",
        "value": "213"
    }
}
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
Constant term (c): <calculated_value>
```

## Implementation Details

- **Language:** Any language except Python.
- **Approach:** Polynomial interpolation using Lagrangeâ€™s formula or other polynomial coefficient solving methods.

java Main input.json
```

## Notes

- **Testing Environment:** Any IDE or environment can be used.
- **Duration:** The assignment is designed to be completed within 70 minutes.
- **Submission:** Push your solution to a GitHub repository and submit the link along with your output.
